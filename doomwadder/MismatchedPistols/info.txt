A pair of mismatched pistols, miraculously they use the same ammunition. The pistol on the right is
rather accurate and hits with moderate force, taking most small demons down in a few shots. On the
other hand, while the left pistol lacks in firepower it has a deadly, albeit inaccurate, 3-shot
burst firemode. You are able to reload them at lightning speed, so reloading them, albeit tedious,
shouldn't be much of an issue.


CONTROLS:
Fire - Spectre (Right Hand) (Can be changed to Left Hand in DECORATE)
AltFire - VSP (Left Hand) (Can be changed to Right Hand in DECORATE)
Reload - Reloads both guns simultaneously (optional, guns automatically reload when empty)
